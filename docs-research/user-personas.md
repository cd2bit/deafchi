# User Personas and Scenarios

Reminders: 
1. Focus on scenarios / behavior patterns of personas, not demographics / mere backgrounds of personas
    - Describes the flow of an persona's day, environment, skillsets and goals
    - Compare and contrast between personas' stories, finding a common thread between scenarios
2. Identify a dominant story, goals, and gaps through research and interviews

### Persona #1: Saad (Name changed to protect the identity), who is new to Chicago

**Current Situation**
As an international student, Saad has been taking classes at an university and has been living in Chicago for two years. Far from home, family and friends he grew up with, he has been attending local social events to make new friends; however, he has realized that it's difficult to making friendships in Chicago. The reasons, he felt, are several:

1. The people of Chicago has their own groups, and while they welcome those who are new, they tend to be content to stay comfortable with their own people, which is hard to break into.
2. While Saad does not drink alcohol for personal reasons, he's comfortable with hanging out and having conversations with people at the bars; however, since they know that he doesn't drink, he doesn't get invited as much as those who drink. 
3. Many of the social events he discovers online are one-time type of event, or a deaf-related event that, as he later would realize, attracts a higher number of hearing sign language students than deaf/hard-of-hearing people. In the first type of event, he meets interesting people, but rarely any contact has turned out to be something. In the second type of event, while he enjoys meeting hearing students, he'd prefer to get to know someone who shares the same language heritage (signed)

In addition to looking for new friends, he's seeking a volunteer tutor who would help him with written English (Already, he's fluent in both spoken/written and sign language of his native country and British and American Sign Languages). His current tutor, provided by the university, does not sign, which makes it difficult to help translate sign language concepts and structure into written English structure.

Before he graduates, he'd like to explore more of Chicago and what it offers. To get around, he relies on public transportation, and is knowledgable about how it works. For this reason, he looks for events that are easy to get there. More specifically, events that are low-key entertainment, like games, and are easy to strike up good conversations, especially about international cultures, learning new topics, and career opportunities.
